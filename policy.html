  <h2><b>Return Policy</b></h2>
  <p>At <b>Ajay Enterprises</b>, we do not have a general return policy for the products we sell. However, in the event that a product is damaged, a return policy will apply.</p>
  <p>Before purchasing, we ensure that customers are shown samples and given a clear understanding of the product. If, after purchasing, a customer wishes to return the product, returns will not be accepted unless the product is damaged.</p>
  <p>We trust and hope that our customers will support us in maintaining this policy and understand the importance of the process.</p>
